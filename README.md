This program builds a chain of words, from the beginning to the end, changing one letter at each step. The algorithm is based on BFS, where the words from the list that differ by one letter are connected by an edge.
The user needs to enter two words of the chain, the initial and the final, after which the program will output the entire chain, if it is possible to create it.

Experiments have shown that this algorithm works a little faster in python than in C++
